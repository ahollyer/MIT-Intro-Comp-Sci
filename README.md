# MIT-Intro-Comp-Sci
##Programs written for MIT 6.00: Introduction to Computer Science &amp; Programming Using Python

----

This repository contains problem sets and practice exercises from the course. All course materials are available at [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/).

As a new programmer, I have found this course valuable for understanding algorithms, time complexity, and computer science basics. The lecturer, Eric Grimson, is outstanding. I'm using this repository to track my progress as I work through the course.

You can also check out the free textbook that accompanies this course: [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html) by Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, and Chris Meyers.

*Note: This course is from Fall 2008. There is a newer version of the course (and the textbook), but after trying both versions, I found that the lectures by Professors Guttag and Grimson are more in-depth than the newer lectures. The older textbook is a faster read because the newer one has built-in practice exercises, which at my current skill level were trivial/unnecessary. Definitely check out the new version and see if you prefer it, though!*
